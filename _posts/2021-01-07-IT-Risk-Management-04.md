Now that we understand what is a risk and how to categorize or
even measure them, we need to know what should be the correct
way to deal with them. We can tackle a risk in 4 different ways. They are as follows : 

01. Risk avoidance
02. Risk mitigation
03. Risk tranferance
04. Risk acceptance

**Risk avoidance** is one of the ways by which we can deal with a
risk. It can be defined as elimination of the risk via a change in 
design or in the system configuration to avoid a risk associated
with a particular vulnerability. So, risk avoidance can be used to
patch a vulnerability completely. WannaCry was a ransomware
cryptoworm that targeted computers running Windows OS via an
exploit of SMB protocol. In this case, we can avoid risk of data
corruption by simply switching over to Mac OS instead of
Windows. This will render this particular vulnerability obsolete.

**Risk mitigation** aims at minimizing risks and bringing them to
an acceptable level by adding risk controls. Letâ€™s assume that we
have a server running Windows. So, it is possible that this server
could be susceptible to many other known or even unknown
vulnerabilities. One way to mitigate this would be to install all the
latest patches that Microsoft puts out. This would lower the risk of
data loss or corruption in our servers.

**Risk transferance** is employed if the organization can not afford
to avoid, mitigate or accept the risk. In such a scenario, the
organization would transfer this risk to another organization. For
example, there are many environmental factors which are beyond
our control. A flood, being one of them, can damage a significant
amount of assets. Such incidents cannot be avoided and mitigation
is not very effective in these cases. It would also be extremely
expensive to just accept the risk. In such situations we can get an
accidental insurance which would cover our damages. By getting
an insurance, we have effectively transferred the risk posed by a
flood to the insurance provider.

**Risk acceptance** is generally employed when the risk is low
enough to not warrant any countermeasures, or when the cost of 
preventing the risk far outweighs the potential damages that might
be caused due to it. Risk acceptance is generally preferred after
proper risk management has already taken place.

At the end of the day, we know that there is no perfect software or
network. And that we will still have risks associated with our
systems even after multiple precautions are taken. However, with
proper mitigation the risk can be minimized to an extent that we
are comfortable to accept it.
