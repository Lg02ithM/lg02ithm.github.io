With the recent rise in popularity of telephoto lenses on smartphones, we have come to see bold claims
from manufacturers like 30X zoom or even 100X superzoom. A friend of mine who recently purchased a
S20 Ultra said to me “The picture quality looks good up to 25X zoom, but after that it becomes very
soft”. And that got me thinking about the time when I bought my first point and shoot camera. It was
the same thing back then – with manufacturers claiming shocking figures like 160X, 200X or even 300X
zoom on a camera.

So, in this short article, I will try to explain about the differences between digital and optical zoom. First,
let us start with optical zoom. Optical zoom is achieved in photography when we use the physical
properties of a lens or a group of lenses to magnify an image. We have all seen a magnifying glass in
action – how it concentrates a large amount of light onto a very small area. The same underlying
principle holds true for an optical zoom.

In order to understand the magnitude of the “zoom” obtained, we see manufacturers come up with
figures like 2X, 3X zoom and so on. This 2X or 3X value is obtained by dividing the longest focal length
available by the shortest focal length available. For example, in a lens with focal length – 20mm to
50mm, we would have a 50/20 = 2.5X zoom. This means that a higher zoom value doesn’t necessarily
mean that you are getting a larger magnification. The zoom value merely tells us about the ratio of
magnification obtained. Let’s understand it with a simple example. On one hand we have a lens that is a
10mm – 100mm (where 10mm and 100mm are the minimum and maximum focal lengths) and on the
other hand, we have a 100mm – 200mm lens. The first lens will be considered to be a 10X zoom lens
and the second lens will be a 2X zoom lens. However, the second lens will provide twice the
magnification as that of the first. So, we can see why this language is sometimes confusing and even
misleading for people.

Now that we have a basic understanding about optical zoom, we shift our focus over toward digital
zoom. Digital zoom can be considered to be nothing but glorified cropping. What that means is that with
digital zoom, we are basically cropping into an image and then resizing it to get a magnified view of the
image. When we do such a thing, we are losing out on the original megapixel count of the image. So, if
we started out with a 10mp image and zoomed in digitally by a factor of 2, we would be left with a 5mp
image. And this is why the image quality starts to deteriorate rapidly when we start zooming into it
digitally.

So, in case of S20 Ultra, where we came across the mindboggling 100X zoom – the camera
approximately uses 20X optical zoom and the rest is digital. That is why, my friend felt that the image
quality started getting bad after 30X zoom.
So, that was a short overview about digital and optical zoom. Please feel free to share your suggestions
or queries below.

P.S. Some of you might remember the “Moon-Mode” on Huawei phones that was able to take super
detailed shots of the moon via “AI assisted digital zoom” or at least that was what they claimed. The
truth was that they used more than just AI algorithms for those photos. Multiple reports stated that
Huawei alters the photo completely by adding previously taken images of the moon and adding in into
your image. So, my general recommendation would be to take all these tall claims about super zoom
with a pinch of salt.
