Risk management in IT and cybersecurity starts with the basic
question, “What is a risk”. Risk can be defined as any situation
where we expose something that has a value to danger. So, in this
article we are going to discuss the different types of risk, different
ways of dealing with it and different ways of calculating the risk.

What is a risk? A risk is defined as the intersection between assets,
vulnerabilities and threats. When we are talking about assets, we
are talking about anything owned by a company which has value.
It can be laptops, workstations, mobile devices, switches and so
on. Now all of the items mentioned above are considered tangible
assets. But in addition to these tangible items we can also have
intangible items as well that have value. This includes things like
information and data, specific processes that are followed in an
organization, things like specific software developed by the
organization and so on. Let me give a few examples of assets in my
previous company. I used to work as a software developer for Samsung and some tangible assets around me were
workstations, chairs, tables, multiple mobile devices, televisions,
videoconferencing equipment’s and so on. Now coming to
intangible assets, some examples were the proprietary softwares
used by our organization, confidential codebase, patents that we
were working on and so on.

Now let us shift our attention towards vulnerabilities. A
vulnerability can be defined as the quality or state of being
exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed in a way
that can cause damage to our assets. So, it can be any weakness in
the organization, misconfigured network devices or a general lack
of preventive mechanisms.

Finally, we come across the term threat. A threat can be defined as
any person or condition that can cause damage to an asset.

Let’s consider the example of a house. There are many valuable
items present inside the house. So, these items and the house can
be considered as tangible assets. The person owning this house
might also have multiple fond memories from his childhood
associated with this house. These can be considered as intangible
assets. Now let’s assume that the owner leaves the door unlocked. This would be defined as a vulnerability. However, in
order to have a risk we must also have a threat. A vulnerability
without a threat is not an issue. If nobody comes to check whether
the door is open or not, we do not have an issue. In order to have a
risk we need a threat. In this case, that can be a thief who wants to
get inside the house to steal things.

In the field of cybersecurity, IT professionals have to be aware of
the fact that there are multiple vulnerabilities out there. There is
no single perfect computer system, network or software out there.
So, it is very important that we take steps to reduce the possible 
vulnerabilities as much as we can. We cannot remove 100% of the
vulnerabilities but we can control and manage a lot of them
through proper risk management. As such vulnerabilities are
considered internal factors. It is something that is under our
control. Now coming to threats, these are any conditions or people
that can cause harm to our assets. Examples of threats in IT
include malware getting into our system, breach of data, cyberattacks, files getting corrupted by ransomware. It can also be
natural incidents like fires, hurricanes, floods which can cause
massive damage to our resources. Threats as such are external
factors which we have no control over. We cannot stop threats but
we can manage and mitigate them. Finally, we can come to risks.
Risk is the possibility of the realization of a threat. It needs both a
vulnerability and a threat to exist. If we don’t have a vulnerability,
then there is nothing that a threat can exploit. Conversely, we can
have a million vulnerabilities but if we have no threats then there
is no risk at all.
