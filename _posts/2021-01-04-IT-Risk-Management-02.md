In the previous article, we went over the definitions of risks and threats.
Now, we would try to understand how to categorize risks and threats.

### Types of risk

01. **Strategic risk**

Result from operating in a specific industry at a specific time. This
results from shifts in consumer preferences and new evolving
technologies which can shift product preferences rendering
existing product lines obsolete. An example for this can be what
happened to Nokia. They were not able to keep up with change in
consumer preferences and hence died out.

02. **Compliance risk**

The risk posed by legislative laws and bureaucratic regulations.
This is because if we don’t comply to regulations we can be fined
or even moved out of business.

03. **Operational risk**

Failures resulting from internal failures in internal processes,
people or systems. For instance, a power outage can result in
downtime of servers.

04. **Reputational risk**

It refers to the risk of losing company’s reputation or its
community standing due to product failures, lawsuits or negative
publicity. For example, when news about Apple’s planned software
obsolescence spread, it suffered widespread backlash.

*Some other examples of risks might be environmental risks. A
natural calamity like floods, hurricanes can cause widespread
damage to any company. Another type of risk is employment risks.
Any organization needs employees to get job done. However, there
exists a risk of rogue employees — people who leak sensitive
internal information to competitors. We can also have a risk of
having sub-standard employees or even shortage of employees.*

### Types of threats

01. **Adversarial threats**

People or organizations that are trying to break into our networks
with the aim of trying to hurt our business. Examples of this can
be trusted insiders, competitors and suppliers who aim to hurt
your organization.

02. **Accidental threats**

It can occur when someone makes an honest mistake which ends
up hurting the security of the organization. For example, a newly
joined employee who has not been trained properly can
accidentally leave a network misconfigured. This can result in a
vulnerability which could be exploited by a hacker resulting in
damage and data loss.

03. **Structural threats**

It occurs when equipment, software and environmental controls
failing inside the organization. For example, it could be data loss
caused due to a failing hard drive. It might even be shutdown of
servers due to overheating caused due to malfunctioning HVAC’s.

04. **Environmental threats**

Occurs when natural or man-made disasters occur. Recently we
saw the wildfires in California. It caused damages to houses and
server-farms. A flood can also cause disruption in power source
which can disrupt work.
