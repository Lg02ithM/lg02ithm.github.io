The year 2020 has been a weird year. The COVID pandemic spread throughout the world at an alarming
pace – it infected and killed countless people and brought the entire global economy to a standstill. I
was going through a few articles and it was stated that the economic shock caused due to COVID was
the largest that has been seen in decades. However, things are getting better slowly.
In this article, I would like to touch upon economic indicators that are being widely used to assess and
monitor the current economic situation. Most of us would be aware about GDP and GDP per capita as a
tool to measure economic growth. We also use many high frequency economic indicators like passenger
vehicles sales, tractor sales, rail freight weight, PPI, CPI etc. Recently, I came across a few other
interesting tools that can also provide valuable information regarding the state of the economy.

With the widespread adoption of smartphones and mobile internet in the country, it is safe to assume
that companies like Google have amassed huge amounts of data which can be used to assess the
current economic situation. A very good example of that would be location data from Google. Prior to
the lockdown, people were commuting to offices on a regular basis. But after the pandemic, that
number has reduced drastically. So, what I mean to say is that the information about people’s
movements collected daily can serve as an indicator about the level of economic activity taking place on
any given day and that the tech giants would most probably be the best source for that information.
