Hello! As a kid, I was fascinated by machines - especially the big and bulky ones. My father is an engineer in a power plant and he would show me pictures of giant machines
that he would encounter at work and I loved them. I also dreamt of driving them but sadly, that has not happened yet :( So, I have decided that the next few articles
would be centred around machines and other engineering marvels. And in this first article of the series, we would be taking a look at the mighty Kharkovchanka - Soviet 
designed snow cruisers which were crucial in the Antarctic exploration.

### Early exploration
America was one of the first countries which made special vehicles designed for the sole purpose of Antarctic expedition. Considering the harsh climate of the region,
America needed something that was robust, easily repairable and most importantly something which would protect its inhabitants from the freezing weather outside. Their 
answer was the Antarctic Snow Cruiser - a futuristic looking vehicle which would serve as the mothership for the Antarctic expedition of 1939.

The vehicle was designed in such a way that everything was accessible from inside the vehicle - people could live, cook and work from inside the vehicle. They could even carry 
out repairs without exposing themselves to the cold harsh weather outside. However despite all the futuristic looking exterior, the snowmobile turnt out to be a massive
disaster when it finally arrived in the Antarctic. The tyres were not well suited for the snow and the vehicle was terribly underpowered. Then came the World War II and
America ended the whole Antarctic expedition prematurely. These vehicles were last sighted in 1958 by an international expedition and have been lost ever since.

### Soviet Antarctic Expeditions
Now, the Soviet were a bit late to the party when it came to the Antarctic exploration, which is ironic considering the fact that the first sighting of Antactica is now widely acknowledged to have taken place in January 1820 during the voyage of two russian ships - Vostok and Mirnyi. Nevertheless, as the International Geophysical Year opened up in 1957, they came up with bold plans to explore the frozen wasteland. The first Soviet expedition started in 1955 and they established their first base - Mirnyi. Most of the machines that they carried during this time was simple military or civilian tractors. But they soon realized that they needed something better to deal with the harsh environment of the Antarctic. So, during their second mission, they came prepared with the mighty ATT tractors - precursor to the Kharkovchanka. These were trucks built on top of a heavy artillery platform in the famous Kharkov machine building plant in Ukraine - most famous for producing the T-54/T-55 battle tanks. Some of these tanks are still in service today. Anyway, these ATT tractors were much better suited for Antarctic exploration, however, some issues still remained. The later version of the ATT tractors came with wider tracks and turbochargers. But, it was clear that incremental updates were not the solution and that the Soviet needed to make something from scratch - a vehicle designed solely for purpose of Antarctic exploration.

For the fourth Soviet Antarctic expedition, something big had been planned - a full traversal of the Antarctic from the Mirnyi base to the geographic South Pole which would cover a distance of over 5000 km across some of the harshest and least explored terrains on the planet. The Soviet already had a capable platform (the large upgraded ATT tractors) and had gathered a lot of experience from their previous missions. So, for this ambitious mission a new vehicle was commissioned. They wanted this vehicle to retain the pulling power of the old tractors and also add accomodation for crew members inside. And in order to design such a cabin they needed help from the Kharkov Aviation Plant. They helped design and build a futuristic cabin made from aircraft grade duralumin (to reduce the weight) which was insulated with multiple layers of nylon. The cabin space they designed had an integrated living & working space, sleeping bunks, airline style toilets and place for cooking. They also had small glass domes for taking in meteorological readings and for navigation purpose. The entire project - from conceptualization to building the machines was completed in three months with people working day and night to finish the project within deadlines.

What resulted from this was the "Project 404C" also known as the Kharkovchanka - 8.5m long behemoth which weighed over 35 tonnes. This machine could reach speeds upwards of 30kmph and could tow 60 tonnes as well. It had the ability to carry 2500 litres of fuel which gave it a range of about 1500km. So, finally in early 1959 three Kharkovchanka's landed in Mirnyi to begin their ambitious roundtrip to the South Pole. This expedition was lead by A. G. Dralkin and very soon the crew started facing some problems with these machines - which were untested and had been built under extremely tight deadlines. The major problem that they faced was caused due to the massive weight of the machine which causes issues like broken tracks and very high fuel usage. The machines also faced problems due to the extreme cold weather outside - when parked outside without heaters turnt on, the temperature in the cabin would drop to -12°C overnight. Now, in order to keep the heaters running, you also had to keep the engines turnt on, which would sometimes cause diesel fumes to spread inside the living area. One of the Kharkovchanka also developed a problem with its gearbox. However, despite all of these difficulties they managed to reach the geographic south pole (Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station) where they were extended a warm welcome from the American team. 

These vehicles then became the backbone of all Soviet exploration activities in the Antarctic region where they performed the crucial task of hauling supplies from the coast to various inland Soviet bases. Later in the 1970's, a successor to the Kharkovchanka was made - the Kharkovchanka - II. With the second and final iteration of the Kharkovchanka, many of the problems of the earlier design were ironed out. They ditched the whole integrated cabin design and moved over to a cab over body design which was reminiscent of the earlier ATT tractors. This design allowed for better access to the engine (which was a problem with the earlier integrated design) and eliminated the problem of diesel fumes seeping inside the living containers. Sadly, after the Soviet broke up, all further efforts for developing newer versions of these machines came to a halt. But, these machines went on to carry their duties as late as till the early 2010 - over 50 years of service for an untested vehicle working in some of the harshest, most remote locations on the planet. By the way, the Kharkovchanka - II's can still be found working in the Antarctic. But these machines are seldom used today for land exploration missions as they have been replaced with newer, faster and more fuel efficient snow-cruisers.

These amazing machines are a testament to the amazing engineering and design skills of the Soviet people and they are still fondly remembered and celebrated.
