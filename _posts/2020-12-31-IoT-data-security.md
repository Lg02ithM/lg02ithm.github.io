IoT or Internet of Things describes the network of devices (with embedded sensors, software or
other technologies) created with the intent of connecting and sharing data with other devices and
systems on the web. Today, thanks in part to the availability of cheap computer chips and
advancements in wireless network technology, anything and everything can be turned into a part of
this network. Smart fridges – check, smart bulbs – check, smart speakers – check. The list goes on.
I recently came across a report by Gartner that stated that there would be over 21 billion IoT devices
by 2020. While a lot has been said and demonstrated about the usefulness of these devices, we also
have a few serious problems about these ubiquitous devices. And security is one of them.
The rapid adoption of these devices has opened up multiple new vulnerabilities for networks. One
major incident that comes to mind would be the large DDoS attack that affected DNS servers on the
eastern coast of USA in 2016. Upon investigation, the attack was traced back to hackers who were
able to infiltrate networks via insecure IoT devices.
One of the reasons why malwares are a serious issue for IoT devices is because most of these
devices have almost no security features built into their hardware. Most of these devices simply lack
the computational capacity which is required to set up a strong security system. And the problem is
exacerbated by the fact that most of the IoT devices that have been sold in the past few years do
have the ability to receive firmware updates. So, there is no way to patch even known vulnerabilities
in these systems.
However, many manufacturers have started making changes and have implemented improved
security features on IoT devices. Furthermore, with the rapid increase in the number of IoT devices,
there has been an increase in the number of security researchers who are continually monitoring
these devices for new exploits and vulnerabilities. Some interesting facts from their findings are that
majority of the IoT devices sold have passwords that are hardcoded and thus can be easily guessed.
Another find was that more than 90% of IoT transactions take place over an unencrypted channel –
which is honestly a startling figure in my opinion.
Going forward, we can all be certain that IoT adoption is set to increase exponentially. And
considering the current state of affairs regarding the security issues plaguing them, we need to
implement better security features in these devices as soon as possible. Product designers in the IoT
space should take steps to ensure that they build smart and secure devices with security built into
them from the start. We also need legislation to step into the matter and ensure that proper
practices are followed everywhere. Enterprises using IoT devices have to ensure that they procure
secure devices and that they update these devices whenever necessary. And as for the common
consumers, the least that we can do is to set up a password once we get our hands on them.
